# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to give the management of PyBer a better understanding of the impact that the type of city can have on their business. This allows the CEO to make business decisions with better and more thorough information.
## Results:

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)

We can see in Fig1 that the average ride fare for Urban cities is much lower than those in Suburban and Rural cities with Rural cities having the highest average fare. This is likely due to the fact that many Urban cities are much more densly populated meaning that rides are shorter on average. 

We can see in Fig7 that there is a much larger group of drivers in Urban areas. This again makes sense due to the fact that these areas are more densely populated and therefore there are more people requesting rides in these areas. 

We can see in Fig6 that Urban areas make up two thirds of the total rides taken by PyBer users. 

We can see in Fig5 that while average fares are lower in Urban cities, the total fares make up a much greater percentage of the total fares. This is again due to the larger populations of these areas resulting in a larger number of rides occuring.

## Summary:

There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. (4 pt)
