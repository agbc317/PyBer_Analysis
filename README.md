# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis was to give the management of PyBer a better understanding of the impact that the type of city can have on their business. This allows the CEO to make business decisions with better and more thorough information.

## Results:
We can see in Fig1 that the average ride fare for Urban cities is much lower than those in Suburban and Rural cities with Rural cities having the highest average fare. This is likely due to the fact that many Urban cities are much more densly populated meaning that rides are shorter on average. 

We can see in Fig7 that there is a much larger group of drivers in Urban areas. This again makes sense due to the fact that these areas are more densely populated and therefore there are more people requesting rides in these areas. 

We can see in Fig6 that Urban areas make up two thirds of the total rides taken by PyBer users. This makes sense with the fact that there are higher populations in these areas and there are far less car owners in these areas meaning that people are more likely to need to take a PyBer ride than people in the Suburban and Rural areas. 

We can see in Fig5 that while average fares are lower in Urban cities, the total fares make up a much greater percentage of the total fares. This is again due to the larger populations of these areas resulting in a larger number of rides occuring.

In the PyBer fare summary we can see that the trend of Urban cities having the highest fares with Suburban in second and Rural with the lowest fares continues. This follows the trends we have seen in the other graphs and makes sense with the trends for total fares, total rides, and total drivers.

## Summary:
My recommendations focus on the Suburban cities because these are the areas that it would be easiest to grow the number of drivers and users. 

My first recommendation would be to target potential drivers in these Suburban cities as these areas are second in total fares, average fares per ride, total fare per city type, total drivers, and total rides. This would be an easy segment to expand and would allow for growth for the company.

My second recommendation would be to implement a gradual increase in Urban prices. This is the city type that accounts for the largest portion of total fares and total rides. I think that by implementing a gradual increase in prices it would allow these cities to be even more profitable. 

My third recommendation would be to target potential drivers in Urban cities with smaller numbers of drivers. Urban cities are the city type that have the largest range of driver count. By increasing the driver count in these under serviced cities, PyBer could increase the fare and ride numbers in these cities which would boost the productivity of PyBer.
